# GithubRepolisting_website
I have created this project using HTML, CSS and Javascript, Bootstrap and Jquery.

This is a website that is hosted on netlify(https://muskanjain-github-repo-list.netlify.app/), that helps you to search for a specific github-user.
The details about the user that are displayed are:
1. Name
2. Profile Picture
3. Bio
4. Location
5. Twitter handle
6. Link to their Id
7. Repositories

One can choose the number of repositories to be viewed on the page at a time. The default is set-up to 10.

Features:
1. The data is fetched from Github API and drawn into different CSS components.
2. The loader is displayed, when the API calls are in progress. It is implemented using Jquery.
3. Pagination is applied and one can click on LOAD MORE button to fetch other results.

To run this code on your system:
1.Clone this repository on your machine.
2.Run index.html on your browser.
3.Have a stable internet connection.
